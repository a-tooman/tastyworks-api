# Contributing Guidelines

This is a work _in progress_, just listing the important points as they arise

## Python Language Rules

We follow the [Google Python style-guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md) as it's a no-nonsense guide that's just right for the project in its current state. It also helps that it is very widely adopted.

We do however have some exceptions:

* Linting: Please lint with `flake8`. While we appreciate the depth and strictness of `pylint`, we find that it's not right for us at this stage of the project's life.
